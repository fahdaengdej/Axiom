"Axiom: Talk to me" is inspired by a scene I saw in "Wall-e" 
when the captain of the Axiom spaceship went through the archives 
on the computer regarding the earth and was mesmerized by the little
things. The project emulates the concept where the user speaks to the
archive and extract of the content pops up.
